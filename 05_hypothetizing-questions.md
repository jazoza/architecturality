# Hypothetizing questions

This process is lead by a quest to formulate questions, rather than find possible answers. In order to allow for questions to emerge from data, we use the process we term "hypothesizing" which describes an observation of importance of certain terms through the measure of their appearance in scientific writing (something we consider documented in goodle n-gram project)

## N-grams for the initial list of keywords
This list of keywords is used to gather tweets in the keyword-based collection process. It is also used to identify profiles to stream.
`keywords = ['BIM', 'DynamoBIM', 'Revit', 'AutoCAD', 'Autodesk', 'Rhinoceros 3D', 'Grasshopper 3D', 'Rhino 3D', 'CAAD', 'computer-aided', 'data-driven', 'model-based', '3dprint', 'parametric', 'parametricism',  'parametricist', 'IoT', 'iot', 'sensor', 'network']`

`BIM,DynamoBIM,Revit,AutoCAD,Autodesk,Rhinoceros 3D,Grasshopper 3D,Rhino 3D,CAAD,computer aided,data driven,model based, agent based`

We look at the books published since 1960 (there is little mention of the terms from the list prior to 1960 and their meaning might have changed too)


BIM, DynamoBIM, Revit, AutoCAD, Autodesk, Rhinoceros 3D, Grasshopper 3D, Rhino 3D, CAAD, computer-aided, data-driven, model-based, 3dprint, parametric, parametricism,  parametricist, IoT, iot, sensor network
