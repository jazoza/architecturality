    "In order to find interesting enough discourse on Twitter, which is relevant to understanding the relationship between digital tools and architectural design, I started with a short list of users that satisfied the following conditions: the protagonists of this discourse would have to be real people and they should be speaking as themselves rather than in front of companies, institutions or similar entities. To begin with, I  selected eight accounts which returner from a search of Twitter profiles for “architect” and OR|\"digital, parametric, computation, data, data-driven”. I selected the accounts that came up at the top of this search and corresponded with three relevance criteria for the research. Relevance criteria are: 1) the user tweets about architectural design and tools in an explicit way; 2) the user mentions the word 'digital' or 'data-driven' or 'parametric' every less than 50 tweets; 3) the users shares opinions; Meeting of these criteria is determined based on my qualitative assessment.\n",
